# Conway's Game of Life

A simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life in Preact, rendered using Vite.

## About The Project

Conway's Game of Life is a simple game of cellular automata devised by mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. The game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.
